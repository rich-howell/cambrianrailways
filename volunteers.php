                            Cambrian Heritage Railways is run by a team of dedicated volunteers who are working to preserve and protect the heritage infrastructure of the railway and its associated buildings. We have already achieved a great deal in the past few years, opening the line to Weston Wharf, building a brand new station there, and adding  the infrastructure you see now, but all that needs additional help to run and  maintain, which is where you may enjoy lending a hand.  
                            If you can spare just a few hours a month, we can’t wait for you to join our friendly volunteers. Any skills, or purely enthusiasm (and not just Railway related) is welcome,  we are inclusive, we will find a role for everybody. Your time and effort mean a great deal to us.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            Thank you for your interest in our railway, and we look forward to welcoming you in person to our volunteering team.

                                        is to ensure that the crossing is safe before trains are signalled to move, this
                                        involves ensuring the gates are closed, we don’t have any electronic signals
                                        yet, so
                                        the crossing keepers are also required to check for correct pathing of the points, change the points where required  and manually signal
                                        the
                                        trains.</p>

                                    <p>As a crossing keeper, you must learn how to open and close the gates and the
                                        principals around signals and points and general train and Railway safety procedures.</p>

                                We have a wide range of ages on the railway, from teenagers to the over eighties. Older people can continue volunteering providing they are fit enough for the job in hand. More sedate tasks can be allocated to those who are not physically able. Persons aged 16 and over can volunteer on the railway, however, CHR is also forming a Junior Branch where under 16’s will be able to help in various aspects of the Railway.
