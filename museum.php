                  <p><strong>The Cambrian Railways Museum exhibits memorabilia associated with the railway system operated by the Cambrian Railways Company and its successors, together with other items of railway interest.</strong></p>
                  <p>It is situated in the historic border town of Oswestry in England, which is where the Cambrian Railways Company chose to site its headquarters. Housed in a former goods depot constructed in the 1860’s, it tells something of the history of a railway system that in its heyday extended to almost 300 route miles largely in Wales, stretching from Whitchurch in the east to Aberystwyth in the west and from Pwllheli in the north to Brecon in the south. Besides numerous photographs, signs, lamps and signal box fittings, the collection includes a huge miscellany of unusual items, ranging from a G.W.R. pen nib, to the headboard first used on the Royal Train when the Prince of Wales (later King Edward VII) visited Aberystwyth in 1896 for installation as Chancellor of the University. Significant in 2014, the centenary of the onset of WW1, we have commissioned the conservation of the Roll of Honour published as early as 1915 which lists the men of the Cambrian known to be serving in uniform.</p>
                <p>Adjacent to the museum is the impressive Cambrian Station building and an original Cambrian signal box currently having its fittings replaced, and that rare survivor nowadays, a town centre goods yard with its sidings still in situ, although presently a large part of the goods yard is utilised as a public car park (an important source of much needed revenue). In due course, it is hoped to return the area to more authentic use to include the display of appropriate rolling stock. There is even the possibility of restoring the livestock pens to reflect the importance of farming on the local community</p>
