First built in the 19th century for the Oswestry and Newtown Railway, Oswestry South signal box was operational for over 100 years. Unlike much of the neighbouring railway infrastructure, it escaped demolition but was stripped of its contents and equipment and remained a shell for many years. Recently Cambrian Heritage Railways volunteers have spent countless hours refurbishing the structure and sourcing and installing appropriate equipment. Although there is still much to do it is now in a position whereby members of the public are able to visit and see just how a signal box operated.
